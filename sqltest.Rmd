```{r}
# install.packages("knitr")
# install.packages("DBI")
# install.packages("RSQLite")

library(DBI)
db <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), dbname = "sql.sqlite")

knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection="db")
```


```{sql, connection=db}
FROM '~\Code\R\R-scripts\data\sh_session.csv'
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
